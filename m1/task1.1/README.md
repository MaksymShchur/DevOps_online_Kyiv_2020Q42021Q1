# Results
In this module I created a repository on GitHub and familiarized myself with basic git commands by doing some branch manipulation.

## Viewing created branches
The red color marks the remote branches, which can be seen on the githab:

## Solving conflicts when merging branches.
When merging the images and styles branches into develop, there was a conflict in the index.html file because it was modified simultaneously in both of them. Difference of the index.html file in the styles and images branches:

After a merge error on the develop branch of this file, it was manually modified to avoid a conflict. As a result, the developer branch has this index.html:

## What is DevOps?
Devops is an intermediate layer of specialists between testers, developers and system administrators. Its task is to provide automatic testing and deployment of applications, as well as their further support and monitoring.
