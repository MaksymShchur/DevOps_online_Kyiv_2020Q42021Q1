We built networks of computers using hubs, switches and routers, and also learned the difference between their work in practice.

## Hub
As we can see, the hub simply sends packets to all hosts on the network:

If we remove IP addresses from computer settings, then packets will not be sent:

## Switch
A switch is a smart hub, so to speak. It does not send packets to all hosts on the network, but only to the one to which the packet is addressed:

## Router
Routers allow us to connect different networks:
